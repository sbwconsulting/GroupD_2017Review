Code to process data for the GroupD Ciac 2017 File Review Evaluation

The code will not run as it is lacking the credentials to access the file system. 
That said all the files needed are included, so with some edits to the code it should be rerunable, though that has not been tested.

The procedures for creating the gross evaluation data files are in createReportData.py

Additionally there are R files that were used to do the file review of the ATR data.
